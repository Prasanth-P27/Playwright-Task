# Playwright PDF Comparison Test

This project uses Playwright to compare the text content of two PDF files and generates an HTML report.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- PDFs placed in the `pdfs/` directory as `file1.pdf` and `file2.pdf`

## Running the Test

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

Run the PDF comparison test:
  

   npx playwright test tests/comparePdf.spec.js

This will compare the text content of pdfs/file1.pdf and pdfs/file2.pdf and log results to the console.

Generating the Report
After running the test, generate the HTML report from the existing report-data.json:


    node reports/generate-report.js
